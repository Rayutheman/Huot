                <h2>Young Huot</h2>
                <p>Huot's life started on September 1st 2008. He was just an infant 
                but in his blood he knew what a beast he was. He grew up playing 
                basketball at first , but as puberty hit him, he soon realised the
                love he had for a sport called "Volleyball". As a young skinny lad
                he was said to have really good genes in his village, tall, strong,
                and some migh even argue for handsome. With all he had he started to
                become the most legendary volleyball player cambodia has.</p>

                <h2>When he became Pro</h2>
                <p>If you ask any volleyball player who the greatest setter of all time is, they'll probably answer with 'Huot' more times than not.
                    The Cambodian is widely considered the GOAT for good reason.
                    At 15 years of age, he's been playing the sport for his entire life and has amassed almost 400 matches in his
                    career.
                    At 190cm tall, as with most Cambodian players, he's not a particularly physically gifted player but makes up for it with simply unmatched talent.</p>
